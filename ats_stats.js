Revalidated objects donâ€™t incur cache update performance hits, but they do still lead to (what ends up being unnecessary) network traffic with origin servers.A high percentage of revalidated cache lookups may indicate that Traffic Server is being too aggressive with its object staleness heuristics",

These were requests which located a matching object in the cache, but it had already been expired fully and a new copy was retrieved from the origin server. Unfortunately, the new copy from the origin server ended up being the unchanged from what had been marked expired in the cache.a high percentage of cold misses indicates that your origin servers are setting expirations on their responses which are too short, as compared to the actual lifetime of the content in those responses",

"The percentage of cache lookups which located an expired cache object and which resulted in new data being retrieved from the origin server",
